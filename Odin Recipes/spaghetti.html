    <p>This Perfect Southern Spaghetti Sauce Recipe is a savory and rich thick spaghetti meat sauce filled with aromatics, spices and herbs ready to devour over pastas or in baked dishes!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> ½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li> 1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li> 2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1½ cups water</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>½ pinch dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 ounces uncooked spaghetti</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion until all pink is gone; drain.</li>

        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, water, salt, parsley, basil and pepper; mix well. Heat until sauce boils. Break spaghetti in half and drop into sauce a little at a time. Cover and turn to low.</li>
        <li>Cook until spaghetti is tender, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking to pan and from noodles sticking together. Add water, 1/2 to 1 cup, if it starts to dry out and noodles are not cooked.</li>
    </ol>
