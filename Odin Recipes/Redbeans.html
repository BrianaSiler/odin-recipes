    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. dry red beans</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil </li>
        <li>14 oz. Andouille sausage</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
        <li>3 ribs celery </li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)
        </li> 
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>6 cups water </li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp salt, or to taste </li>
        <li>1.5 cups long grain white rice (uncooked)</li>
        <li>3 green onions </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>The night before, add the dry beans to a large bowl with double their volume in water. Allow the beans to soak in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
        <li>When you're ready to start cooking, slice the sausage into rounds. Add the cooking oil and sliced sausage to a large pot and cook over medium until the sausage pieces are browned. Remove the cooked sausage with a slotted spoon to a clean bowl. Place the cooked sausage in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the dish.
        </li>
        <li>While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion, bell pepper, and celery. Mince the garlic.
        </li>
        <li>After removing the cooked sausage, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot. Saut√© over medium heat, allowing the moisture from the vegetables to help dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the pot as you stir.
        </li>
        <li>Add the smoked paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, black pepper, and bay leaves to the pot. Stir and cook for one minute more.
        </li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with 6 cups water and give the pot a brief stir to combine the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring it up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let the pot boil for one hour, stirring occasionally. Replace the lid every time you stir.
        </li>
        <li>After boiling for one hour, the beans should be tender. Begin to smash the beans with the back of a spoon against the side of the pot. Continue smashing the beans and letting the pot simmer without a lid for 30 minutes to thicken the pot</li>
        <li>While the beans are simmering for their final 30 minutes, cook the rice. Add the rice and 3 cups water to a sauce pot. Place a lid on top, turn the heat on to high, and bring it up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the rice simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice rest for 5 minutes without removing the lid. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
        <li>Once the red beans have thickened, add the cooked sausage back to the pot along with 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley. Stir to combine. Taste the red beans and add salt to your liking. Start with 1 tsp and add more as needed. I used 1 Tbsp total (3 tsp)</li>
        <li>Serve the red beans in a bowl topped with a scoop of rice and a sprinkle of sliced green onions.</li>
    </ol>
